    Hello everyone, today I'm going to show you how to configure system settings.
    First, let's navigate to the Administration panel and select System Settings from the dropdown menu.
    Now, we need to locate the Security tab and review all current settings. 
    It's important to adjust password policies and access controls as needed for compliance.
    Next, let's navigate to the Performance section and optimize cache settings and database connection parameters based on system load.
    After completing these configurations, run the system diagnostics tool to verify all settings are applied correctly and monitor performance for 24 hours.
